# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Have you ever been in the car, scrambling for either a google maps app or physical map for directions during your road trip? But the destination isn't necessarily the priority- the journey along the way is what's important. With our RoadTripRunner app, you'll have the ability to map out different routes along your road trip, while searching preferable attractions, restaurants, hikes, etc. along the way. Want to take the freeway the whole way? Would you rather take the scenic highways? With RTR, it's up to you. Our MVP will have a search feature, which will give the user route options, alongside an attraction search feature. Users with login via authentication and will be able to save their destinations via the app's connection to a database. Before, during, or after a trip, users can login to view their trip and all their destinations along the way. With RTR, the journey is the destination.

### Features
-Search feature to look up routes with to/from locations
-connecting to a database
-authentication (and eventually authorization)
-use of APIs


### Technologies
Java- backend
MySQL- to store users' trips, possibly for categories as well
Hibernate
SpringBoot
Thymeleaf (and eventually transition to Angular post-MVP)

### What I'll Have to Learn
This project HEAVILY relies on APIs, specifically those from the google/google maps suite. We will need to learn how to connect to such APIs to receive different route options for mapping out road trips.
